# [Sprint Challenge Name]

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Sprint Challenge.**

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past sprint and apply them in a concrete project. This sprint explored **[overall sprint objective]**. During this sprint, you studied **[module 1 theme], [module 2 theme], [module 3 theme], and [module 4 theme]**.

In your challenge this week, you will demonstrate your mastery of these skills by creating **[basic project type].**

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. All projects will be submitted to codegrade for automated review. You will also be given feedback by code reviewers the Monday after challenge submissions. For more information on the review process [click here.](https://www.notion.so/lambdaschool/How-to-View-Feedback-in-CodeGrade-c5147cee220c4044a25de28bcb6bb54a)

You are not allowed to collaborate during the sprint challenge. However, you are encouraged to follow the twenty-minute rule and seek support by dropping a :wave: in your help channel when needed.

_You have **three hours** to complete this challenge. Plan your time accordingly._

## Introduction

[Paragraph descripting project functioning. As an example:

In this project you will create a login page and request a token from the server that you'll use to send all other requests to the server. You will then be able to fetch the color data array, update data, and delete data, and watch the fun happen!]

## Instructions

### Task 1: Project Setup

* [ ] Fork and clone this repository.
* [ ] Create a new working branch: git checkout -b `<firstName-lastName>`.
* [ ] Implement the project on your newly created `<firstName-lastName>` branch, committing changes regularly.
* [ ] Push commits: git push origin `<firstName-lastName>`.
* [ ] **RUN** `npm install` to install your dependencies.
* [ ] **RUN** `npm start` to start your application.

### Task 2: CodeGrade Setup

* [ ] Open the assignment in Canvas and following along with the attached document [here.](https://www.notion.so/lambdaschool/Submitting-an-assignment-via-Code-Grade-A-Step-by-Step-Walkthrough-07bd65f5f8364e709ecb5064735ce374).
* [ ] Follow instructions to set up Codegrade's Webhook and Deploy Key, making sure your deployment is set to your `<firstName-lastName>`.
* [ ] Push your first commit: `git commit --allow-empty -m "first commit" && git push`
* [ ] Check to see that Codegrade has accepted your git submission.

### Task 3: Project Requirements

 Your finished project must include all of the following requirements.

#### [Requirement Category: Authentication]

  [Brief description of category: Build a login form to authenticate your users.]

* [ ] Task 1
* [ ] Task 2
* [ ] Task 3

#### [Requirement Category: Consuming the API]

  [Brief description of category]

* [ ] Task 1
* [ ] Task 2
* [ ] Task 3

  **Notes:**

* [add any other notes specific to your sprint here]
* You are welcome to create additional files but **do not move or rename existing files** or folders.
* Do not alter your `package.json` file except to install extra libraries.
* In your solution, it is essential that you follow best practices and produce clean and professional results.
* Schedule time to review, refine, and assess your work and perform basic professional polishing including spell-checking and grammar-checking on your work.
* It is better to submit a challenge that meets MVP than one that attempts too much and does not.

### Task 4: Stretch Goals

 **IMPORTANT:** Only work on stretch goals after completing your MVP!

 When completing these goals, make sure to use a **new branch** to ensure your MVP code is not overwritten. You can branch off `main` by executing `git checkout -b stretch`. When you are fully sure your stretch code is ready for feedback, merge your stretch code with main using `git checkout main` and `git merge stretch.`

  After finishing your required elements, you can push your work further. These goals may or may not be things you have learned in this module but they build on the material you just studied. Time allowing, stretch your limits and see if you can deliver on the following optional goals:

* [ ] [Stretch goal 1]
* [ ] [Stretch goal 2]
* [ ] [Stretch goal 3]

### Reference Materials

[include any links or descriptions nessissary for project development]

#### [Reference type: API Documentation]

* [Information and / or link 1]
* [Information and / or link 2]
* [Information and / or link 3]

#### [Reference type: Hex Color Examples]

**Note** [Any information needed for processing reference]

* [Information and / or link 1]

## Submission format

* [ ] Submit via Codegrade by commiting and pushing any new changes.
* [ ] Submit a pull-request to merge <firstName-lastName> branch into main. **Please don't merge your own pull request and make sure you are on your own repo**
* [ ] Check codegrade for automated feedback.
* [ ] Check codegrade on Monday following the Sprint Challenge for reviewer feedback.
* [ ] Any changes pushed to your <firstName-lastName> branch will resubmited to codegrade if pushed before the sprint challenge deadline. Changes after the deadline will not be reviewed.
